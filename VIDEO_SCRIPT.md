# HackRadar - 2.5 Minute Loom Video Script

## Scene 1: Google Meet Introduction (30 seconds)
**[All team members on screen via Google Meet]**

**Chip (Ciprian):** "Hey everyone! We're the HackRadar team - I'm Chip, the developer and AI architect."

**Luca:** "I'm Luca - Chip's son - handling frontend and UI/UX design. Yes, we're a father-son team!"

**Chip:** "In the next 2 minutes, we'll show you how we're helping hackathon teams improve their projects with real-time AI feedback. Let me share my screen..."

## Scene 2: The Problem (30 seconds)
**[Screen share: Show hackathon team perspectives]**

**Chip:** "Every hackathon team faces the same challenge: You build something amazing but wonder - are we on the right track? What should we improve? How do we stand out?

Teams want feedback during the event, not just scores at the end. They need guidance to iterate and improve.

Meanwhile, judges have to evaluate 100+ projects fairly in just hours.

That's why we built HackRadar - to help teams succeed."

## Scene 3: The Solution Demo (60 seconds)

**[Show AI processing]** Our AI analyzes it across judging criteria - clarity, problem value, feasibility, originality, and impact.

**[Show scores appearing]** In under 30 seconds, they get detailed feedback...

**[Show feedback]** But here's the key - specific suggestions on HOW to improve...

**[Show improvement]** Teams can iterate and resubmit to see their progress!

**[Quick feature highlights]**
- Supports any format - text, images, PDFs
- Remembers your previous submissions
- Tracks your improvement journey
- Provides actionable guidance, not just scores

## Scene 4: The Technical Approach (30 seconds)
**[Show simple architecture diagram]**

**Chip:** "We kept it simple but effective:

Using Anthropic's Claude for intelligent analysis, MongoDB for data persistence, and Next.js for a smooth interface.

The magic? Our system remembers your journey - each submission builds on the last, showing real progress.

And importantly - this complements human judges, it doesn't replace them. We help teams put their best foot forward."

## Scene 5: The Impact & Call-to-Action (30 seconds)
**[Show real team feedback]**

**Chip:** "We built this during the hackathon and immediately got feedback from teams using it:

- 'Finally, specific guidance instead of just scores!'
- 'Love seeing our progress tracked'
- 'This helped us refine our pitch'

We talked directly with teams - their eyes lit up when they saw actionable feedback.
