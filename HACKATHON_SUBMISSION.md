## Product Description
HackRadar is a revolutionary AI-powered real-time hackathon evaluation platform that transforms how hackathons are judged and participated in.

Teams receive continuous guidance throughout the event, while organizers get comprehensive analytics and fair, consistent evaluation across all projects.

Built in under 12 hours during AGI Ventures Canada Hackathon 3.0, HackRadar demonstrates enterprise-level architecture with production-ready deployment at hackradar.me.
