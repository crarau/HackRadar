# HackRadar - Team Success Tool for Hackathons

## Refined Positioning
HackRadar is a **team feedback tool** that helps hackathon participants improve their projects in real-time. It provides AI-powered suggestions to guide teams toward stronger submissions, complementing (not replacing) human judging.

## Key Messages (Toned Down)

### For Teams
"Get helpful feedback as you build. Upload your progress, receive specific suggestions, and track your improvement throughout the hackathon."

### For Organizers  
"A supplementary tool that helps teams self-assess and improve their projects. Human judges remain the final decision-makers - this just helps teams put their best foot forward."

## What We Built
- **Real-time feedback system** using Anthropic's Claude API
- **Progress tracking** for teams to see their journey
- **Actionable suggestions** based on common judging criteria
- **Simple upload interface** for any format (text, images, PDFs)

## Customer Validation
During AGI Ventures Hackathon 3.0, we conducted informal interviews with participating teams:
- **Teams appreciated** getting specific improvement suggestions
- **"Their eyes lit up"** when they saw actionable feedback instead of just scores
- **Direct customer contact** - we were in the same room, getting real-time reactions

## Current Usage Stats
- **Active Teams**: Multiple teams signed up during the hackathon
- **Updates Submitted**: Teams actively using the feedback loop
- **Positive Reception**: Teams found the guidance helpful for refining their pitches

## Important Clarifications
- ✅ **Helps teams**, doesn't judge them
- ✅ **Complements human judges**, doesn't replace them  
- ✅ **Provides guidance**, final decisions remain human
- ✅ **Built with Anthropic API**, straightforward tech stack
- ✅ **Customer-validated** through direct hackathon participant feedback

## Simplified Tech
- Next.js frontend

## Value Prop (Concise)
