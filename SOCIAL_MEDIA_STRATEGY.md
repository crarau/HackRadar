• Instant actionable feedback to improve your project
• Live leaderboard to track competition

### Post 4: Technical Deep Dive
```
🧠 The tech behind HackRadar:

We're using a multi-agent AI architecture where specialized agents evaluate different aspects:
• Technical Innovation Agent
• Business Viability Agent  
• Presentation Quality Agent
• Progress Tracking Agent

Each agent provides targeted feedback, then we aggregate scores in real-time using WebSockets for instant updates.

Stack: Node.js, React, OpenAI API, WebSockets, PostgreSQL

The challenge: Processing any file format in <30 seconds while maintaining quality evaluation.
