## Post 1: Team Tool Launch
```
ðŸš€ Launched HackRadar at AGI Ventures Hackathon 3.0

A simple tool to help hackathon teams improve their projects through AI feedback.

What it does:
âœ… Provides specific improvement suggestions
âœ… Tracks progress throughout the event
âœ… Helps teams refine their pitches
âœ… Complements (not replaces) human judging

Early feedback from teams has been encouraging - they appreciate getting actionable guidance rather than just scores.

Built with: Next.js, MongoDB, Anthropic Claude API

Try it: hackradar.me

## Post 2: Customer Validation
```
ðŸ’¡ Best part of building at a hackathon? Direct customer feedback!

We talked with teams using HackRadar during AGI Ventures Hackathon 3.0.

Their reaction: "Finally, specific guidance on HOW to improve!"

Not trying to replace judges - just helping teams put their best foot forward.

â€¢ Real-time feedback helps iteration
