1.5 hours in at AGI Ventures Canada Hackathon 3.0 and we're already in production!

We just shipped an AI-powered real-time evaluation system that gives hackathon teams instant feedback as they build. No more waiting until the end to know if you're on track.

âœ… Domain bought (Namecheap)
âœ… DNS configured (Cloudflare)
âœ… Deployed on Vercel 
âœ… SSL certificates active
âœ… Google Authentication working
âœ… MongoDB Atlas connected
âœ… Next.js + React 19 running
âœ… GPT-4 integrated
âœ… Live at https://hackradar.me

Teams can upload anything - PDFs, code, pitch decks - and get scored instantly across multiple criteria with actionable feedback.

The speed of building at Invest Ottawa is unreal. 90 minutes from zero to deployed!
