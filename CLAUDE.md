2. States the achievement and timeframe clearly
3. Explains the value proposition in one sentence
4. Lists accomplishments with checkmark bullets (✅)
5. Includes technical stack briefly
6. Ends with a call-to-action and URL
7. Adds relevant hashtags (15-20 max)
8. Keeps it under 1300 characters for optimal engagement
```

### X (Twitter) Post Creation Prompt

```

### Key Social Media Tips
- **Post frequency**: LinkedIn every 2-3 hours, X every 30-60 mins
- **Always include**: Screenshots, metrics, team mentions
- **For awards**: Tag @AgiVentures, use #AGIV #AGIVenturesCanada #BuildToConvert
- **Engagement**: Reply to all comments, create threads, share progress
